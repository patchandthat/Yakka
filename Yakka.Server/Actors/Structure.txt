Message router actor is the primary point of contact for all clients, and routes messages to the appropriate coordinator

ChatCoordinator and ClientCoordinator are siblings, and can chatter between so that ChatCoordinator has an up to date client list

ClientCoordinator handles logins, heartbeats, and keeping clients updated with client list (child actors as appropriate)

ChatCoordinator has children { Shout, whisper, conversation coordinator }

Conversation coordinator manages set of conversations between users and makes sure messages are delivered to the right conversation

Client code may dispatch all messages to a top level router?
Or hold some actor refs to chat coordinator and client coordinator once authenticated?
